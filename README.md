# postgres_backup_container

This repository is accompanying the the following blog post:

    http://t-heiten.net/docker/docker-recipes/recipepostgres-bâ€¦docker-container/

It already comes with the backup database, and all set up to be run by the compose.sh script.

If you want to follow along just run the clean.sh script first.

Make sure that you have a local postgres installed (or at any machine at your disposal, or even in another container) To create the sample
database.
It also works if you use your own database and simply adjust the scripts.

enjoy and check out my other recipes:
